# Python Pandas
Pandas is a powerful data analysis Python library. I have used Pandas Framework to analyse datasets on schools and students.
In this assignment, I have used the Pandas library to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. I have analysed the district-wide standardized test results mainly the reading and math scores of students to uncover onbious trends in school performance.

- Pandas and Jupyter notebook was used to write the code and create dataframes.
- Single script which runs on both the data sets.

The final report includes the following:

**District Summary** 
A high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
Total Schools
Total Students
Total Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math
% Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**School Summary**
An overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per School Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math
% Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)**
A table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include:
School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per School Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math
% Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**Low Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)**
A table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include all of the same metrics as above.

**Math Scores by Grade**
A table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

**Reading Scores by Grade**
A table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

**Scores by School Spending**
A table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. The table includes each of the following:
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math
% Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**Scores by School Size**
Breakdown by grouping schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

**Scores by School Type**
Breakdown by grouping schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).

**Analysis Observations**
From the above analysis, the following conclusions could be drawn
- It is clear that the top 5 performing schools are:
  1. Wilson High School	
  2. Pena High School	
  3. Wright High School	
  4. Cabrera High School	
  5. Holden High School	

- Schools with higher spending averages, has lower overall passing rate.
- Medium and small schools have higher overall passing rate compared to the larger schools.
- Finally Charter schools have higher overall passing rate than district schools.
