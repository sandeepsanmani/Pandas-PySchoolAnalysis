Pandas is a powerful data analysis Python library. I have used Pandas Framework to analyse datasets on schools and students.
In this assignment, I have used the Pandas library to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. I have analysed the district-wide standardized test results mainly the reading and math scores of students to uncover onbious trends in school performance.

- Pandas and Jupyter notebook was used to write the code and create dataframes.
- Single script which runs on both the data sets.

The final report includes the following:
